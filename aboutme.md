title: quick background about me :D

Because of the non-technical background of just studying cyber security and political aspect of it, I want get my hands-on technical aspect of cybersecurity I start to get the knowledge of certification like A+, network+ and LPIC … that’s where I get to enter to technical knowledge, but not certified, and learned basic concept of programming with python,c and c++ ... Then jumped back and forth in learning from googling and learning the internals of OS and any RE challenge  beside learning CS from [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), finally I seek to develop skills and experience in RE and low-level security fields like Malware analysis
